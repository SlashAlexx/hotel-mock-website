# Hotel Website

A mock website for a hotel company created for a final course assignment.

# Overview

In this project, I was asked to create a website containing four different pages for a hotel company to boost employee training and increase winter profits by highlighting our wintertime amenties. Below are the 4 pages created:

- Home
- Amenties 
- Employee Portal Login
- Employee Training Center
### Note

This project was completed with little to no HTML / CSS experience and during finals week, which took around 30 hours to complete. There is definetly spaghetti code. if you have advice or suggestions, please let me know!
